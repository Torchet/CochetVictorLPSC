2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_125_scalp_zynqps_sys_clock_0 and clk_vga_vga_hdmi_clk_rst_system_inst_0_vga_hdmi_clock_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

XDCB-5#4 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ *ila_core_inst/u_trig/N_DDR_TC.N_DDR_TC_INST[*].U_TC/yes_output_reg.dout_reg_reg/D}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '103' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
